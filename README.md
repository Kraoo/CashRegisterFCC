# Cash Register Project

## Overview

This project is a simple cash register web application created as part of my learning journey on FreeCodeCamp. The purpose of this application is to simulate a basic cash register where users can add items with their prices and then process the payment for those items.

## Features

### 1. Adding Items
Users can add items to the cart by entering the item name and its price in the designated input fields and clicking the "Add Item" button.

### 2. Displaying Cart
The application dynamically displays the items added to the cart in a list format, showing the item name along with its price.

### 3. Updating Total
The total price of all the items in the cart is updated in real-time as items are added or removed.
